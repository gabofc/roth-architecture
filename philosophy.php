	<p class="philP scrollAnimation">Furthermore, we engage with local communities to learn from their ancient traditions and usher a process of co-creation, where our philosophies fuse to develop projects that are culturally attuned to the places where we are invited to build. By integrating these materials, techniques and knowledge, we reveal the endemic potentialities of the natural, the cultural and the human dimensions of a project, committing ourselves to sustainability and a reinterpretation of ancestral knowledge.</p>
